#### Summary
In this blog, you will find the top 5 places Katsuhiko Maeda would like to visit and why I want to vist those places. 

**1) Top 5 places I want to visit**
1. Machu Picchu (Peru)
2. Banff National Park (Canada)
3. Ca√±o Cristales (Colombia)
4. Torres del Paine National Park (Chile)
5. Marrakesh (Morocco)
I have been fascinated by these places every time I look at them on TV, magazines, and on the internet.

**2) Why I want to vist those places**
Although my decisions are not based on numerical decision criteria 100%, I selected the list carefully based on my careful research and comparison of places in qualitative measures. The criteria I used to select those five places out of many beautiful places God created are as follows:
* How beautiful is the place?
* Risk of vising the place (Can I return home alive?)
* Can we visit with my family?
* Ite
* The cost to visit the place
(The higher up, the more important important criteria for me)
