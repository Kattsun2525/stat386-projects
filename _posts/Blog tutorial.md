In 2020, the amount of existing data in the world was estimated to be 44 zettabytes and is projected to be 175 zettabytes by 2025, which is nearly four times more than all the existing data in 2020. Many companies today have pushed themselves to leverage this data opportunity by accelerating digitalization. However, many of them have not been successful in becoming data-driven organizations, meaning they have not leveraged data capabilities to extract insights to make decisions effectively throughout the organization. 


## Data strategies and initiatives often fail despite large investments in data and analytics
According to NewVantage Partners Big Data and AI Executive Survey 2021, 99% of 85 well-established and leading companies reported that they have actively invested in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence initiatives and nearly 92% of the companies accelerated the investments. Clearly, the trend is that companies have taken the initiatives to leverage increasing amount of data in the world. Only 24% of the participated companies reported they have created a data-driven organization. This demonstrates many companies are not successful in becoming a data-driven organization. This means that companies are committed to data-driven transformation but have been struggling with executing the commitment properly.

## 3 major barriers to implementation
### Barrier 1: Culture
The first most common reason why companies have been struggling to become data-driven is culture. According to OO, 92.2% of the surveyed companies mentioned culture as the biggest hurdle to becoming data driven organizations. Becoming a data-driven organization requires much more than just possessing the right technology and strategy. The employees need to be fully aware of the value of harnessing data solutions and capable of making informed decisions based on data analytics tools. In addition, the company should have the right processes and systems to leverage data solutions.

### Barrier 2: Difficulty of attracting and retaining talents
According to McKinsey Global Survey, many companies find it difficult to both attract and retain analytics talent, especially business users with analytics-related skills. Of the 519 companies in the survey, 48% of them struggle to find the talent and 42% face the talent retention problem.  

### Barrier 3: Senior leader involvement and lack of a clearly defined data strategy
Company executives are key to organizational effectiveness at harnessing data and analytics capabilities. Without having a clearly articulated data analytics strategy and initiative, companies would not be able to create a data-driven culture that permeates through every division of the company. 

Also, only 33% of the companies in McKinsey Global Survey reported that they have adopted Chief Data Officer (CDC) role successfully, while the role of CDC is not clearly defined or not even established for the rest of the surveyed companies which are mostly unsuccessful in leveraging data capabilities. 


## How to overcome the challenges
To combat these challenges, companies should take into account the following suggestions from Harvard Business Review:
1.	**Center data initiatives on business problems that could yield impactful results.** By doing this, c-suite executives will be able to demonstrate the value of harnessing data capabilities and might increase senior leader involvement.
2.	**Reevaluate the data strategy.** Companies should take into account how data is generated in the whole value chain process and can be merged to improve the process as a whole, rather than focusing on certain areas of business.
3.	**Long-term commitment to become a data-driven organizatioin.** It takes a lot of efforts and time for an entire organization to change and adopt new solutions. Also, leveraging data requires building knowledge and skills over a time because those can be difficult for some people to pick up.


## Conclusion
Dspite the increasing amount of investments in data analytics capabilities, many companies have struggled to incorporate a data-driven culture that permeates through the entire organization. They often lack clarity on their data analytics strategy because of a lower commitment level of their senior management team. This results in having unestablished systems and unskilled employees who are not capable of incorporating data analytics into their daily decision making process. For companies to leverage data effectively, they need to have all the necessary components in place, such as right strategy, people and culture. This requires a long-term commitment and patience but can give companies a huge advantage over competitors who are struggling to become data-driven.
