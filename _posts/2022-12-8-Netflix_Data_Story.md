#	Quick project recap
A while ago, I read news articles which mentioned how Netflix has lost many subscribers as COVID-19 faded away and is currently facing many challenges like new competitors and account-sharing problems. This led me to question what their current standing is in comparison to the last decade and how investors reacted to the recent drop in subscribers. I decided to take this project as an opportunity to answer those questions. In my previous posts, I talked about the data collecting, cleaning, and exploring steps. Please check those blogs if you are interested in the topics. This blog focuses on the important key takeaways to answer my original research questions based on the dataset.

#	Data Story
To answer my original questions in my project, I decided to use Netflix’s stock price as a measurement of their earning potential and future viability. The graph below shows the stock price and the total volume of stocks traded in a day over the past decade.
<p></p>
Netflix had experienced a steady growth from 2013 until pre-COVID. Then the stock price soared by roughly $350 in the midst of COVID-19, which is almost double their pre-COVID price. This growth was facilitated by COVID-19 as people had more leisure time at home and signed up for Netflix. However, the stock price dropped by 71% and reached $200 in a matter of six months after November. We can see that the investors reacted negatively to this drop as the transaction volume increased during that time. This most likely contributed to lowering the price even further. As of now, the stock is on an upward trend but has not recovered to the pre-COVID price.

# Conclusion
Despite Netflix’s remarkable growth in the past, their business currently in in a tough spot. The stock price was highly overvalued at the time of their growth during COVID-19. And the investors are doubtful of their future viability due to the increasing competition in the market and their account-sharing problems. Without major improvements in their services and fixing the account-sharing problem, it seems difficult to bring back their growth.
