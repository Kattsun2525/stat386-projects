#	Introduction/Quick project recap
A while ago, I read news articles which mentioned how Netflix has lost many subscribers as COVID-19 faded away and is currently facing many challenges like new competitors and account-sharing problems. This led me to question what their current standing is in comparison to the last decade and how investors reacted to the recent drop in subscribers. I decided to take this project as an opportunity to answer those questions. In my previous posts, I talked about the data collecting, cleaning, and exploring steps. Please check those blogs if you are interested in the topics. This blog focuses on the important key takeaways to answer my original research questions based on the dataset. (focuses on answering)

#	Data Story/Key takeaways
To answer my original questions in my project, I decided to use Netflixâ€™s stock price as a measurement of their earning potential and future viability. The graph below shows the stock price and the total volume of stocks traded in a day over the past decade.
<p></p>
Netflix had experienced a steady growth from 2013 until pre-COVID. Then the stock price soared by roughly $350 in the midst of COVID-19, which is almost double their pre-COVID price. This growth was facilitated by COVID-19 as people had more leisure time at home and signed up for Netflix. However, the stock price dropped by 71% and reached $200. We can see that the investors reacted negatively to this drop as the transaction volume increased during that time. OOO. This most likely contributed to lowering the price even further. As of now, the stock is on an upward trend but has not recovered to the pre-COVID price.

# Conclusion
In this blog, we have explored the Netflix stock price data to gain an understanding of the data and get insights into how we can proceed to the following analyses. Netflix has seen a tremendous growth, especially during COVID-19 but has been struggling following the pandemic. The potential causes of the declining stock price would be more increased outdoor  activities and threat of new entrants like Disney+. We also saw that investors reacted to the stock price negatively in the volume analysis.
<p></p>
As a next step, I will conduct more of qualitative analyses to understand the reasons behind  the changes in the stock prices and see how they compare against their competitors. I am also going to search for methods to predict future stock prices. Stay tuned for my next blog post.
